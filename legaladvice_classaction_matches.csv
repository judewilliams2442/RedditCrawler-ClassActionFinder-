I live with my dad and brother and i am currently 25yo.

Location: South Africa


Im diagnosed with MDD, adhd and Ocd so I really struggled through the years to get a stable job and keep it.

Long story short we again lost everything in our life. First was when I was very young and we had money, nice house and everything, untill my dad got addicted to sleeping pills and we lost everything and life just spiraled downhill.

Fast forward to about 2019 he went to rehab, got healthy again and got a amazing job able to support us.

We got a new home and except for my mental state everything was well. Until my dad fell of the wagon again, started not gping to work, etc....and in the end we lost the house we were renting.

From there (start of this year) we just kept downgrading until we landed in a shelter house which is a NGO, and the woman running this ""business"" has many, many complaints on facebook on how she treats people and she also has many court cases against her.

Anyway we stayed there about 4 months, didnt sign a single contract or anything about payments or giving like a months notice if we were to move out.

At month 4 I couldn't take it anymore. My brother and dad also started to fold as did almost everyone living there. Our food were expired and I have proof of this. We barely had warm water to shower and she was a complete mental case screaming at people who are actually sick and struggling.

Anyway we decided we cannot take it anymore and on the first of June I think, we told her we found a new place and we want to move on. She then said she is calling the police on us which never happened, and ended up sending my dad a voice note, which we still have, saying to get our fucking things and fuck of out of her yard.

I was there that day while my dad was at work. They started throwing out all our things out of the room, and here comes the part I want to address.

Since the day the Playstation5 came out, i worked and saved my ass of wherever i could to save up money for one and finally I bought it early 2024.

Because of my adhd and Ocd, this thing was my joy, because of how busy it kept my mind in times of crisis or flare ups from my mental illnessess.

This ps5 belonged to ME not even my dad...

So when I went into the room while they were throwing out our stuff I noticed my ps5 missing, and she took it and hid it, saying we need to pay R6000 for the month we didnt even live there., to get it back.

I paid R11000 for that thing and looked after it and was so proud of it because I always hated myself because of my mental struggles.

At this moment, we are homeless. Living guest house to guest house building up debt, friends that only helps for so long, we literally and I mean literally got scammed 2 days ago by someone saying they have a nice apartment for us if we pay half of the deposit.

Out of desperation my dad did all he could and we used every last penny to pay. Turns out there was never a house to rent, it was all a big scam so now we are back at my friend's fathers guesthouse that he is helping us out with.

Anyway Im rambling now. I know things in life are more important than a ps5 console, but that console was my sollice, my peace of mind to not turn back to substance abuse

She still has my ps5, we owe her NOTHING, no contract was ever signed, she is just a plain sick person.

As we live in SA, opening a case at the police for this sort of thing is pointless. We tried believe me.

I just dont know what to do honestly. Is she in the right to do this? I just need some advice.

Thanks everyone.

Edit: the months we lived there, we were paying every month","I live with my dad and brother and i am currently 25yo.

I work for a medium-size company that connects people who want short term jobs completed (moving, construction, etc) with people who can perform them. I’ve been working with them nominally for a few years, and it’s been my main source of income for less than a year. 

At a job yesterday, the client took an obviously unsafe action which resulted in me sustaining a minor injury. I’m not debilitated, but it involved internal damage and I want to see a doctor to make sure I won’t have long term problems. However, my primary care physician won’t let me make an appointment because the accident happened at work, and my employer says they won’t do anything because I’m technically an independent contractor. 

What am I supposed to do here? I was under the impression that my company had insurance for this kind of thing, but it doesn’t sound like they do. They take most of the money clients pay, it would be insane if none of that actually went to keeping their employees safe and healthy. ","Location: North Carolina

"Cited for “passing on the right” after a truck turned across my lane from a striped median. If I fight the ticket and get it thrown out, can I pursue damages?",2,1mjcb6u,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mjcb6u/cited_for_passing_on_the_right_after_a_truck/,2025-08-06 13:19:14,EffectiveAd6616,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mjcb6u/cited_for_passing_on_the_right_after_a_truck/,"Location: Champaign, IL

This is my first car accident, so I need advice. I was driving straight in the of a two-way road with one lane per direction. A truck without a trailer, was in front of me going the same direction and then veered left and slowed down to a near-stop into a striped yellow median area (painted, no raised island), then turned from the median into my lane without signaling. I swerved right to avoid impact, but the truck struck my vehicle in the rear-left.

We filed a police report, and the officer told me to file with my insurance and cited me for “passing on the right,” even though there was only one lane in our direction, and I remained in my lane. He gave me the # for the police report, but didn't mention whether I'm listed as U1 or U2. He said I'm getting ticketed for ""passing on the right lane"", but the ticket says it's for ""improper lane usage.""The officer told me to just go to court to get it thrown out, saying “he didn't care"" if I go and ""it won’t make \[him\] (the officer) mad.” He said I could make an argument that I did not know which way the truck was turning and thought it went into the median to turn left because there was enough room on the right to safely pass without leaving my lane. When asked about truck having no turn signal, the police officer said that because he wasn't there to see it, he can't do anything about that. When I told him that the truck was not in the lane, he stated that trucks can make wide right turns even from outside the lane.

I asked a classmate for advice, a former police officer, and he said that what the cop said was incorrect and while trucks do need to make wide turns, trucks shouldn't need to completely leave the lane to make a right turn, especially without a trailer.

I've called different lawyers to explain the situation, and they said that they don't understand why I got ticketed, but because I got cited, there's nothing they can do about it until I go to court and get it thrown out. The truck driver has a dash cam, but the lawyers said we can't make him hand it over to the police.

My questions:

1. Does the fact that the truck turned right from a non-driving zone (striped median) without signaling strengthen my case that it wasn't my fault?
2. Can I still recover damages from the other driver’s insurance if I was cited but the truck turned unsafely across my lane? I need my car fixed because I am out-of-town for clinical rotations. The police told me to file with my insurance, but my insurance told me that I can file with the truck's insurance but filing with my insurance will probably be faster.","We filed a police report, and the officer told me to file with my insurance and cited me for “passing on the right,” even though there was only one lane in our direction, and I remained in my lane.

We don't want to say whether you will or won't recover here.  Illinois uses modified contributory negligence.  Which means if you were less than 50% liable you can recover apportioned loss.  If, for example, we decide you were 30% liable and your loss was $5,000, you might recover 5000 x 0.7 = $3,500.  \n\nThough it sounds like getting you to less than 50% liability here seems unlikely."", 'created_utc': '2025-08-06 13:26:21'}]"
Turo Charged Me a Late Fee with Zero Proof — and Ignored Their Own Policy,0,1mjb58s,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mjb58s/turo_charged_me_a_late_fee_with_zero_proof_and/,2025-08-06 12:34:59,Puzzleheaded-Law-237,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mjb58s/turo_charged_me_a_late_fee_with_zero_proof_and/,"Location: California, United States

  
Rented a car through Turo in the U.S. recently and got slapped with a **1 hour 29 minute** late return fee — even though I returned the car only 30 minutes late.

Why? Because I didn’t tap ""End Trip"" in the app until later.

# Here's what actually happened:

* Returned the car around 10:00 PM.
* It was a self-return, no host on-site.
* I messaged the host later just to confirm it was dropped off.
* As a first-time user, I didn’t realize I needed to manually end the trip in the app.
* I tapped ""End Trip"" at 11:29 PM, after I was already home.

Turo then charged me a late fee based entirely on that button press — not on when I physically returned the car.

**🔎 Turo’s “Evidence”? Just the App Timestamp**

No GPS data.  
No time-stamped return photos.  
No host confirmation.  
Just the time I tapped a button in the app — which, for the record, does not prove I still had the car.

Even Turo’s own policy says: “Turo will assess late return fees based on verified evidence provided by the host and/or supported by Turo’s own data.”

But in this case, there was no verified evidence — just an assumption based on app activity.

**⚠️ Even Worse: Inconsistent Enforcement**

On another Turo trip I took afterward, I never even ended the trip in the app. No check-out, no confirmation, nothing. And I wasn’t charged anything.

So apparently, if you forget the button once, you’re fined. Forget it another time, you’re not. Makes no sense.

**🤡 Support Was Useless**

I reached out multiple times, explained everything, quoted their own policy, pointed out the lack of evidence, and showed them how inconsistent their enforcement was.

Their answer? “We can't waive the fee without proof that you returned the car earlier.”

So let me get this straight: they don’t need proof to charge me, but I need proof to not be charged?

**🚨 Lesson Learned:**

If you're using Turo:

* Take timestamped photos when you return the car
* Always manually end the trip immediately — even if you already returned the car
* Don’t expect Turo to be fair or consistent
* First-time user? You’re on your own

Just wanted to warn others before they get caught in the same trap.

Has anyone else had issues with Turo charging late fees based only on app check-out time? Did you manage to get it reversed, or did you have to fight it?","Location: California, United States

"Help Creating Legit Will & Protecting Assets (Hospice, Single, 30F)",1,1mjaj2u,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mjaj2u/help_creating_legit_will_protecting_assets/,2025-08-06 12:12:07,IntrovertTurtle9712,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mjaj2u/help_creating_legit_will_protecting_assets/,"Location: Michigan, USA 

Hi all, 

Unfortunately, I am in a situation where I desperately need (and would *greatly* appreciate) quick legal guidance for creating a legitimate will.

Recently we enrolled me in hospice. I would like to ensure that my parents/family can inherit and have access to my assets after I pass — which, sadly,  may be soon.

Right now, I know only the basics: my parents are listed as primary beneficiaries for my 401k’s and banks. However, I also purchased a car (it still has a small lien) and a few other personal assets.

I’m hearing terms being used by my social worker such as “executor of estate”, “durable power of attorney”, and “probate”, but I am not super familiar with the details. My parents have mentioned wanting to “protect my assets from probate,” but I’m not sure how to do that.

I’m looking for trusted and legitimate ways to create a valid will, if ideally with a licensed attorney or notary who could come to my home (since traveling is not an option). Or by using a legitimate website or service. 
I would like to avoid scams or websites that could try to steal my identity or misuse my personal information but am not familiar with any popular services/websites. 

From what little I understand, I think I might need (thanks ChatGPT):
	•	A Last Will and Testament (naming beneficiaries and executor)
	•	A Durable Power of Attorney (financial)
	•	A Healthcare Power of Attorney / Advance Directive
	•	Any steps to help avoid probate for my assets (especially my car)

Could anyone recommend reliable/legitimate resources or services — especially those that will work with people in hospice or offer in-home visits?

Thank you so much in advance — I truly appreciate any help.","I would like to ensure that my parents/family can inherit and have access to my assets after I pass — which, sadly,  may be soon.

They ignored us for 3 weeks but we eventually got the money back; we have yet to see any evidence of contract cancellation despite asking. 

The immediate day following their project, our basement started flooding. We called them about it a plethora of times and got passed around from person to person, refusing to talk to us, saying they’ll come out and never showing up. We had a week of horrible storms and couldn’t get anyone else to come out in a timely manner. Eventually, the project manager agreed to have someone fill the cracks left on the concrete. The following day, the basement flooded again. 

We had a third party come out who found that the concrete foundation was cracked from where they drilled and the pressure during their project; he explained why it was flooding so much, what happened, etc. and it all made sense. 

We have not had a single flood in the 3 years of owning the home. I happened to have a photo of the wall before they did their project (for a totally unrelated reason) and there was no crack. Our 3yo floors that were replaced the week we moved in, have incurred so much water damage that they are warped, buckled, gapped, and still wet underneath, likely covered in mold. We’ve gotten quotes for repairs to the foundation and floors; they all start around $23,000. 

The general manager of the company reached out to us after we finally left an honest, but negative review. He said they *may* be able to work agree to fix the foundation (they are a foundation company at the forefront) but don’t think they are responsible for any other damage or mold remediation (the wall where it is cracked is covered in horrific mold, which is right next to one of our office spaces, we have an animal with severe asthma, and no great ventilation down there). The foundation repair quote was $7500 while the brunt of the cost was the flooring in the large space. He said they’d tell us by end of day yesterday what they’d be willing to do in writing but we never heard from them. We have followed up via text and calling during working hours since it’s a bit too early right now. 

We are waiting on a call back from an attorney later this week, but we are trying to figure out if we have any leg here to push full repairs or pay for another company to do the repairs due to their subsequent damage.

Filed RTI for My Father’s Pending Salary as a Safaikarmi Seeking Guidance and Experiences,0,1mixy7f,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mixy7f/filed_rti_for_my_fathers_pending_salary_as_a/,2025-08-06 02:12:26,Actual-Scene-357,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mixy7f/filed_rti_for_my_fathers_pending_salary_as_a/,"Hello everyone,

I need some advice and would appreciate hearing from others who may have gone through a similar situation. My father works as a Safaikarmi (sanitation worker) and has been deaf and mute since birth. Unfortunately, his salary for the past 3 months has been pending, despite him submitting multiple applications to his office to resolve the issue.

I personally reached out by emailing the DPRO and even CC’d the District Magistrate chief development officer, but there has been no response or progress so far. After exhausting these options, I decided to file an RTI application to get information regarding the status of his pending salary and the reasons for the delay.

I am posting here to ask:

Was it the right step to file an RTI in this situation? Has anyone else faced something similar with pending salaries, especially for government or municipal workers? What was your experience after filing an RTI?

Additionally, are there any further steps I should consider taking to help resolve this issue? Any tips on what to expect next or suggestions for faster resolution will be really helpful.

Thank you in advance for your guidance and for sharing your experiences. It means a lot to my family and me.

I was blackmailed via Snapchat video call – attacker recorded me without alert and shared it on Instagram,0,1mixccd,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mixccd/i_was_blackmailed_via_snapchat_video_call/,2025-08-06 01:33:50,Mustafaaazx,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mixccd/i_was_blackmailed_via_snapchat_video_call/,"Hi everyone,  
I'm sharing this in hopes of advice, support, or visibility.

I was targeted in a scam via Snapchat video call where the other user (a woman, likely a pre-recorded video) lured me into a private situation. I was recorded **without any screenshot or recording alert** from Snapchat. The attacker then **blackmailed me** and later **posted the video on Instagram**, which thankfully **took it down quickly** and removed the account.

I reported everything to Snapchat support. After 24 hours, I received a vague response from someone named “Cindy” but no actual action or confirmation that the attacker’s account was banned. I followed up multiple times, escalated via Twitter, and was told I’d get an email “as soon as possible.” Still nothing.

I have now filed complaints with:

* ICO (UK)
* CPPA (California)
* IC3 (FBI)

This is causing me extreme stress and anxiety. I’m honestly shocked at the lack of urgency from Snapchat compared to Instagram. If this happened to you or you have experience dealing with this, please share.

Should I consider legal action or media exposure?  
Any advice appreciated.

Can a former group home take legal action against me for speaking out about abuse I experienced as a child?,1,1miusoz,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1miusoz/can_a_former_group_home_take_legal_action_against/,2025-08-05 23:07:29,Miserable-Heat9801,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1miusoz/can_a_former_group_home_take_legal_action_against/,"Location: Keller texas 

I’m 18 now. I spent almost 10 years in a group home in Keller,Texas, called Christ’s Haven for Children — a place that was supposed to be a safe haven but ended up being a place where I experienced deep trauma.

I came into the system as a hurting child, already carrying a lot, and I left with even more trauma. Now I’m trying to speak out about what happened to me — not for revenge, but because I know there are still kids there who could be going through the same thing. But since speaking up, I’ve been ignored, silenced, and now I’m hearing that some of the staff may be considering legal action against me — which I feel is retaliation.

Here’s some of what I went through:
	•	I was isolated in a room by myself for weeks as punishment.
	•	I was denied access to church, which is against their own rules.
	•	I didn’t have a phone for most of my time there, and when I did, it was searched constantly.
	•	I begged for help in person and through calls, but no one did anything — so I stopped asking.
	•	I signed placement paperwork at age 8 — with no real explanation of what I was agreeing to.
	•	I was blamed and questioned for things I didn’t do — including false accusations about showing inappropriate videos to younger kids.
	•	Staff tried to stop me from talking to my house siblings and told me I wasn’t family anymore. They distanced themselves, saying I was “dangerous” because of having sexual relations.

I even have screenshots and messages showing those accusations weren’t true — including the child in question saying it wasn’t me and that she felt pressured by staff (Mae and Heath) to say things that weren’t real.

What’s most painful is what happened just in the last few months, while I was still living at Christ’s Haven.

I had an ectopic pregnancy — a traumatic and dangerous medical situation — and I wasn’t even allowed to go to church for support. I was in pain emotionally, mentally, physically. And they still wouldn’t let me go to church, even though that’s against their own faith-based policies. Mae and Heath, the house parents at the time, continued to isolate me and made me feel like I didn’t matter.

Now, since I’ve left and started speaking out (not even using names at first), I’ve heard they’re thinking about taking me to court — supposedly because I “make them look bad.” They’re even telling people I’m a danger, when I’ve never said anything illegal, threatening, or untrue. I’m not the one speaking publicly about them — they are the ones who’ve shared private things about me with others, including members of their church.

Even more frustrating — I reached out to the CEO of the organization, Cassie, asking for a meeting. At first, she was open to it and mentioned possibly involving a board member — I have proof of this. But now, she’s backed out completely and told me to “follow policy” by emailing a formal grievance — to the same people who ignored me as a child. It feels like they’re protecting staff instead of taking accountability.

My questions:
	1.	Can they take legal action against me for speaking out about my truth — even if it’s backed by screenshots, messages, and evidence?
	2.	Is it legal for a child to be forced to sign placement paperwork without an explanation, and for that to be used years later to silence them?
	3.	Are there lawyers or legal resources for people who aged out of the system but were mistreated in group homes?
	4.	Can I be sued for defamation if I haven’t said anything false, and I can prove that?

I don’t live at Christ’s Haven anymore. I have my own apartment. I’m struggling — financially, emotionally, mentally — but I’m doing my best to survive. I’m not trying to hurt anyone, but I want to make sure what happened to me doesn’t happen to another child.

I know I wasn’t a perfect kid. I was surviving trauma. And instead of helping me, they added to it. That should matter.

If you’ve read this far, thank you. I really need guidance on what to do next and how to protect myself from being silenced.","Now I’m trying to speak out about what happened to me — not for revenge, but because I know there are still kids there who could be going through the same thing.

So I was recently contacted by a woman in my state claiming to work for an company called Premium LLC ( used to do OF and stuff ) she goes into specific like about her father who died and talks about real life stuff and I am intrigued. She asks me to pay for her “service” I say sure. First it was through Facebook pay, then cashapp then Venmo and then PayPal. Now chime. We’ve talked otp and I am not sure it’s fake or not. She gives me a deal then Friday says it’s a different deal and we go back and forth about payments and fees and her trying to reason with her manager. I even heard another person she says to be her mom with dementia one time. She said if I couldn’t pay the hold fee they’d start calling my family and friends. She even told me a story that one of her coworkers and their client and it didn’t end well for him. I’ve already sent my check from last week through multiple apps and they said in order to return said money they’d need me to pay for each transaction on each app. She even said the CEO was some paralegal and now I feel like I’m stuck and I honestly don’t know what to do. I’ve been in similar situations where I’ve actually been blackmailed but this seems too elaborate. My best friend said I should contact a lawyer and get advice on how to process this. My other friend said to just block and move on because I haven’t done nothing to warrant any wrath or “action” since there’s no contractual agreement. Any help is appreciated.

I’m 23. Just a city boy who’s still learning about the real world trying to take it one day at a time.

( I also looked for that company name anywhere and found nothing close to what she was talking about )

Quick edit, I have video chatted and can prove this is a real person I genuinely am confused but I understand to an extent that I should preserve all evidence and I’ve been trying to get it out of my head but it’s been eating away at my health and my sanity.","I even heard another person she says to be her mom with dementia one time.

We've done a great job over the past 10 years and wanted to become direct vendors for the PTC. But other subs and even the GC's managers who we've befriended has told us the GC owner gets anyone blacklisted from working with the PTC if they try to compete with the GC.

The owner of the GC company went to highschool with the CEO of the PTC, the wife of the PTC's head of procurement works in accounting for the GC. We know of several subs that have been blacklisted for trying to compete with the GC, and we know the GC has multiple shell companies to make it look like they don't have a monopoly on the PTC vendor list.

"Other Driver’s Insurance Fixed Half the Damage, Now I Found More Issues – Help?",1,1mitxg2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mitxg2/other_drivers_insurance_fixed_half_the_damage_now/,2025-08-05 22:22:26,Aggressive_Hat_6789,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mitxg2/other_drivers_insurance_fixed_half_the_damage_now/,"Location: Alabama, USA 

On April 26, I was involved in a car accident. The other driver was found at fault, and their insurance company agreed to cover the damages. My insurance was not involved because I filed directly with the at-fault driver’s insurer.

My insurance initially stated they needed a police report and would contact me once ready. However, the at-fault driver’s insurance already had the report and confirmed liability, asking me to take my vehicle to a shop for repairs.

I took the vehicle to the dealership, where their inspector determined the damage was limited to a control arm (about $400). I asked the service agent to have their technicians verify because the impact was directly at the front tire. They agreed with the inspector’s assessment.

It took one month for repair approval and another month for payment. I was without my truck until June 6, at which point only the undercarriage damage had been repaired. A small dent on the front bumper remained because the dealership did not have a body shop. I had to go elsewhere for that repair.

When I tried contacting the insurance representative about the pending repair, I couldn’t reach him. I later discovered the claim had been marked “closed.” After several calls to customer service, the representative finally called back, admitting it was a misunderstanding. He said he would process the paperwork to complete the repair.

It took another month just to get an inspector to the body shop to approve the part replacement.

Now, a month and a half after receiving my vehicle back, someone else drove it and said it felt unsafe — swerving with a loose steering feel. I inspected the vehicle and found 10–15 degrees of play in the wheel. The spring and sway bar end link appear tilted backward.

Questions:
	•	Can I reopen the claim?
	•	Is there a time limit to do so?
	•	I never signed any release of liability, and the insurance essentially stopped communicating after directing me to take the truck to the shop.

Restraining order not served but enforceable?,2,1mitpbr,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mitpbr/restraining_order_not_served_but_enforceable/,2025-08-05 22:11:08,tuenthe463,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mitpbr/restraining_order_not_served_but_enforceable/,"Location: Mass/suburban Boston

This is not my sitch but trying to assist a friend.

Friend lives in a small neighborhood Boston suburbs and her neighbor is a menace. Kills her plants along border by pouring deck stain on them (had soil tested).. Aims weird signs at her home, aims second floor cameras at her bedroom (same on other side to other neighbor, he has 7 exterior cameras on a 1000 sq ft home), builds walls of snow, tree branches, whatever to block public access on public land between their homes to river behind them. Has been reprimanded for this  Builds weird illegal fences elsewhere, runs out and films her when she comes outside to garden or go to her car, shouting ""don't harass me! Don't come any further! Leave my family alone."" She is a single (widow) mom with two significantly disabled adult children and has no time or reason to bother him other than when he screws with her. He has beefs of differing levels with all the surrounding neighbors also.

She has a friend/boyfriend Bob who lives out of state and comes to stay with her sometimes for weeks at a time. Bob is a Major help with her kids, has no time for the neighbor and his nonsense, doesn't talk to him or acknowledge him. Bob doesn't have a cell phone or a laptop and has been in Europe for the last 3-4 weeks and comes back in a week.

On Friday her Ring doorbell went off and there were local police at her door. Figuring it was the latest nonsense involving the neighbor, she didn't answer the doorbell but called the police the following morning. They told her they were there to serve a restraining order against Bob, was he home? She said he lives permanently out of state and is in Europe for a month. A retraining order FOR WHAT?!? They wouldn't / couldn't answer her.

Monday she went to the court to file her own RO and met with the magistrate and finds it's same judge who authorized neighbor's RO. Friend has PAGES of his nonsense, legal bills about zoning, soil sample testing from the poisoning of her plants, the works to present. She said the magistrate (sorry if not the right word in MA) was cold bordering on cruel and showed her a printed still photo that was submitted with the neighbor's RO request of Bob walking down her driveway holding a knife. My friend remembers this as a fourth of July picnic where she sent Bob back into the house to get a knife to carve a watermelon where they were picknicking in the back yard.  It's totally out of context and clearly selectively clipped to make him appear as a threat, when he also possesses the video showing Bob ISNT a threat. He's not facing the neighbors home or brandishing the knife, but it is visible in his hand.

The rub is Bob returns to his home in another state 10+ h drive away one day before the RO hearing and my friend was told that whether the RO is served to him or not, it's at the Magistrate's discretion at the hearing to extend the RO potentially up to a year. If he's not allowed in her house my friend is screwed as she's only maybe 60-80 feet from neighbor. One of the kids is having a v serious surgery and Bob's coming back up to help her with post-op care. Neighbors are backing off helping her because they don't want to catch this guy's ire and also become the focus of his nonsense. If he's working to isolate her, it's working. She doesn't have a pot to piss in. She lives off whatever social security the kids get and some money from her deceased spouse's life insurance.

What type of atty should they be seeking?  One of the nutty things is that when he first moved in he asked her to be a reference for his DOD job which she agreed to do  and over the last few years he has  descended into madness, sorry to sound hyperbolic. She's tried to figure out how to rescind the reference. His job at DOD would seem to mean competence with cameras,  listening devices. He has a wife and kids who appear to be afraid to upset him.

Any suggestions?","Friend lives in a small neighborhood Boston suburbs and her neighbor is a menace.

[CA] Landlord prohibits me from having my mail delivered to the property of the address I live in,3,1miomct,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1miomct/ca_landlord_prohibits_me_from_having_my_mail/,2025-08-05 18:17:11,StrategyBig4573,3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1miomct/ca_landlord_prohibits_me_from_having_my_mail/,"Location: California

I have already signed the lease and paid all move-in fees, including the security deposit. I have not moved in yet.

The space I'm renting is an isolated section of the landlord's home. The landlord and I will live in the same building (the landlord's house).

This is the rule in question, found in the House Rules section of the lease:

**Tenant is required to obtain their own PO box to receive mail and packages. House address not to be used by the tenant.**

Before meeting the landlord, I stopped by a USPS post office and brought this up to the supervisor, who said that my landlord could not legally prohibit me from having my mail delivered to my own address. He said something about ""permanent address"".

I asked the landlord about this policy without mentioning what I had been told at the post office. Her rationale was that she wanted to maintain my privacy as well as her own (which doesn't make much sense, as neither of us have any intention of opening each other's mail). I decided to not argue with her.

In this neighborhood, there is a single large mailbox at the end of the street with slots corresponding to each address. I asked if she would be open to installing a separate mailbox for my mail, but she won't consider this.

During this conversation, she said she would allow me to have packages (as opposed to paper mail) delivered to the address of the home.

Is my landlord's mail rule legally enforceable? If not, what should I do if my mail ends up in the home's mailbox? Would I forfeit any of my rights if I bought a PO box? If the policy were illegal and I got a lawyer involved, what would stop the landlord from retaliating against me during my tenancy?","This is the rule in question, found in the House Rules section of the lease:

I work at a Smoothie King and I’m leaving the job soon (tomorrow), but I’ve run into a situation with my manager that I need some advice on.

The other day, I took over a cash drawer from a coworker.  We’re supposed to start with $150 in the drawer.  Before she left, she counted her drawer, dropped what she needed to, and handed it off to me.

At the end of the day, another coworker wasn’t sure if a drop had already been made, so she told me to go ahead and take out $26 (which is how much the first coworker should have dropped) just in case and I did.  when I counted my drawer and entered the amount into the system, it told me I was $26 short. Realizing the job had already been done earlier, I immediately put the $26 back in the drawer and recounted the drawer.

However, in order to enter a recount into the system, I needed a manager pin. I asked my manager for it and she refused. So although I fixed the drawer physically, I wasn’t able to record that in the system. Now she’s telling me I owe the $26 out of pocket.

I tried explaining the situation to her, but she’s still insisting I pay it.  I make $10/hour.  If anyone knows where to go from here please let me know.

Hi! 

I have two occupants in an apartment that is under my name. I do not occupy the space anymore, but they invoked squatters rights and will not leave. The property manager is doing nothing, while they say I am responsible for the rent owed every month since they are claiming I am not legally moved out because I didn’t return the key- Can’t return all keys because the illegal occupants have them. 

I want to go ahead and put an eviction process on the squatters because I want my name off this apartment as soon as possible - and most likely sue the property management for the legal fees and also if they try to claim I owe the rent while not living there. 

Can I serve papers to the squatters? Do I need a lawyer to serve it? Can I just get a generic form to evict ? Any advice please and thank you. 

——To add to the thread.

My mother died three years ago, leaving the apt in my name. The illegal squatters have been forging my signature and impersonating me to renew the lease every year.

Because they is an owed balance as of recent, the property management somehow found me and told me of the balance. This is when I found out in 2025 the apartment has been in my name for years…","I have two occupants in an apartment that is under my name.

So, first this will be a little light on details at the moment because this is information I’m getting from my elderly parents, this is not my property. When my grandfather died, my mother inherited his house. A family friend was offered cheap rent to stay there, and they took that offer. There was a leak in the roof everyone had known about for years, someone was sent out to fix it a few times but it always came back. The renter was advised that if the leak returns, let the family know and they’d come out to take care of it. Renter agreed and kept in touch with my uncle, who lived right next to the place. My uncle would ask him questions about maintenance but never did any surprise visits or inspections, just casual conversation whenever they bumped into each other. He asked about the leak, was told it was fine. Asked about the plumbing and toilet (it hadn’t been replaced in a while), was told it was all good. That was the extent of it. He rented the place for about 10 years with these occasional check-ins, never said a thing. But in the last few years, people wanted to do an actual inspection because there were suspicions that things weren’t being taken care of. He kept making excuses and pushing back any visits, until today. He sent a text message (that I don’t have the exact text of) that boiled down to, “The house is probably a demo job, the air is pretty bad and it’s probably unsafe to breathe, I am GONE.”

So, they went to the house. He was gone, the doors were locked, but the back door was improperly latched. Opening the door, the ceiling is falling down, the floor is sagging due to water damage, the toilet had been removed from the only bathroom and placed in the dining room, it is a disaster. Current objective is to find a copy of the old contract, but I’m wondering if there is anything we should be aware of while we start this process. My first assumption is that this is just tough luck due to trusting the renter and that we won’t have any recourse, but I’m just curious.","The renter was advised that if the leak returns, let the family know and they’d come out to take care of it.

My kid bought a mobile home in a park 3 years ago. He put $1000 cash down and paid the rest off by paying extra with his lot rent every month. Everything was verbal, nothing in writing other than text messages between him, his gf, and the park manager. Trailer has been paid off for over a year now, he's actually paid $1000 more than agreed upon because manager keeps telling him that she isn't sure how much is left and she has to check her paperwork. He has every single receipt. All cash. I'm 100% sure she is skimming and trying to hide it from the owner. 

I've spoken to the title office, the auditor, the county prosecutor, made a sheriff's report for theft, and two lawyers. Both lawyers have told me that they absolutely can get the title for him, but have asked if it's really worth it. Yes it is. Momma is a petty bitch and I know the scam the park manager is running. I have always filed my own paperwork in regards to domestic things, my divorce, custody, contempt. I know how to file all my paperwork, I just need someone to tell me what exactly I'm filing. Is it something I can download off of the state Supreme Court website and just plug in the details? Or am I building paperwork from scratch?","He put $1000 cash down and paid the rest off by paying extra with his lot rent every month.

My mother checked the app because we currently have a power outage. Our electric bill went from 116 to 175 USD. We live in a unit with other tenants and the electric company refuses to look at the actual meter and uses a digital reading. They're claiming that we went 300 kilowatts over.

I've been home by myself and I do not run 50 million things at once. I don't compulsively open the fridge or the freezer, I don't leave lights on 24/7, and I'm not running multiple loads of laundry. At most, my computer is on but other than that, we do not run high energy demanding things.

We do have AC and heating. The AC runs at 73. It's never below 73

Is the electric company within their right to just suddenly jack up our bill like this or are they illegally price gouging my mother?","Our electric bill went from 116 to 175 USD.

Location: IL/USA

We just closed on a house in mid June. We had a separate inspection from a company we chose as well as a mandatory FHA inspection done. The separate inspection clearly states that it is not a mold (air) inspection, but that they will report what/if they see. Neither inspection moves furniture or anything to look for such things. The previous owners were always aware of the dates and times of inspection.

That being said, no floods, leaks, water damage, humidity issues, or mold were disclosed by the previous owners in the legal disclosure forms we signed. The house was NOT sold ""as-is"". Proper realtors were involved on both our ends. 

Three days after we closed, we noticed the first mold growth. We were hoping it was due to the humidity in the bathroom and a poorly working ventilation fan. We replaced the ventilation fan and cleaned the mold. However, over the last month plus (closed 6/18, posting 8/5, probably did not actually start ""living""/spending the night there due to moving and schedule restraints until 6/25), we have found visible mold growth throughout almost the entire house. It is absolutely ridiculous and insane how fast it has grown, so this definitely seemed that it was not an issue that started after we moved in and was pre-existing. We since googled and found that the humidity level in the whole house was too high (we have a smart thermostat) and have purchased two 22 pint dehumidifiers and are running one on each level of the home (bi-level home). This has not seemed to slow down the growth in the slightest.

That being said, we started wondering if the previous owners were aware of the issue, and we were told by our realtor that unless we could prove they knew about the issue before they signed the documentation, that we were basically out of luck, because all they would have to do is lie and say they did not know about the mold and that would make them not have any responsibility. 

Well, as luck would have it, I contacted the previous owner and played dumb, and they did admit (I have screenshots but will not be posting) that they were aware of the mold issue and that they ""controlled it"" with a single large dehumidifier and bleach water spray. I highly doubt this considering we have double the humidifiers and we still spend pretty much every day chasing and cleaning mold throughout the home. We also have found out from neighbors (theirs previously, ours currently) that there was a large flood in the kitchen that broke through to the lower level (with water damage) that was ""fixed"" by the previous owner and not properly done, there have been several floods in the lower level with water damage, they were aware that the house was too humid, etc. NONE of this was disclosed in the paperwork, made aware to us, etc. Some of the patchwork that I am assuming is from the flood in the kitchen that broke through to the lower level was covered with fake vent covers and are absolutely dreadfully done (literally covered with white duct tape underneath!).

With how rapid it is, we cannot use our kitchen. We do not trust eating out of the dishes or eating anything that has been put in the cabinets there. The fridge is outside of the kitchen (in the dining room) and we will eat out of there and use the microwave. We are using a hutch (also in the dining room) as a makeshift pantry. We are eating out daily and spending as much time out of the house as possible. It is not just us. We have children and pets. Three out of four of us have been sick with some sort of respiratory issue since we moved into the home.

We have HVAC coming in a few days to see if there's anything that can be done to help with the humidity levels. We are having an full invasive mold inspection done next week (earliest we could get), and then remediation shortly after that. Depending on how much remediation is needed and how invasive it is, we will also need extensive remodeling. 

We want to hold the previous owners accountable. So far, the bank said they cannot help us and we need legal on our side. Our homeowners insurance will not help us because the mold issue must be caused by an event that they cover (such as a flood or leak) that happened under our ownership. They also recommended we contact legal. I have contacted several attorneys in our area and have barely heard back. I am afraid that I will have to end up going bankrupt to get out from under this house. I will not simply continue living there if we can't afford to get it fully remediated and remodeled back to livable conditions. I have to keep my children's best interest and health in mind, damned be the financial consequence of bankruptcy. However, if there is a solution where we can, at minimum, make the previous owners responsible for the cost of remediation and remodel, then I would be fine with that.

The thing that worries us is that we are now being told that these people (previous owners) were scam artists and frauds. This is apparently not the first time doing something like this. We are convinced that since they knew about the mold (proven) that they simply covered or cleaned up anything that was visible right before the inspections (which they were always informed of exact date and time of!) so that nothing would be found. We have also been told that they have declared bankruptcy themselves to get out of paying back money they owed to either people or institutions. IF I have a case here, is there some sort of addendum that can be put in that would not allow them to declare bankruptcy for what they owe and force them to pay us back? Is there a different route we could take that would be more like recission and make the entire contract null and void, give us the money back that we have put towards the down payment and mortgage, and make the house their problem again? Any and all advice would be great. ","That being said, no floods, leaks, water damage, humidity issues, or mold were disclosed by the previous owners in the legal disclosure forms we signed.

Chiropractor office submitted a bill to collections stating I owe money but they never filed a claim and I paid a copay?,1,1midp6z,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1midp6z/chiropractor_office_submitted_a_bill_to/,2025-08-05 11:22:17,LeleFirebringer,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1midp6z/chiropractor_office_submitted_a_bill_to/,"Location: Illinois 

Hi everyone, 

I started receiving phone calls saying I owe money and at first thought it was scam. Finally my husband calls one day saying they also called him saying I owe $400 to a chiropractic office from a visit in 2022. 

Under my benefits with the FEP BCBS, I only owe a $40 copay with no deductible for chiropractic visits. Limited to x amount a month. I never go, this was a one time visit. 

I went to the office and they said some billing was just now getting caught up and that I had a deductible at the time that I hadn’t met. Which isn’t true, I never owe deductibles. She then contradicted herself and said at the time I was told about a payment plan since I didn’t have insurance. Also not true, I gave them my insurance and have proof from my bank account that I paid my $40 copay. 

Anyways, finally today I called BCBS and they said a claim was never filed and the time has passed for them to file.

How do I move forward? Can I dispute this? I want to know my rights with this as I am definitely not interested in paying $400 at the fault of their own for not filing a claim in time. That’s not my responsibility. 

TIA","Finally my husband calls one day saying they also called him saying I owe $400 to a chiropractic office from a visit in 2022. I never go, this was a one time visit.

Samsung demanding I pay for two phones despite never receiving any.,2,1mi9v7q,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mi9v7q/samsung_demanding_i_pay_for_two_phones_despite/,2025-08-05 08:55:26,No_Fucking_Thanks,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mi9v7q/samsung_demanding_i_pay_for_two_phones_despite/,"Location: Australia

A few months ago, I ordered a new phone from Samsung's official eBay store. A few hours later, I decided I wanted a different color, so I canceled the order on eBay. I received a confirmation that the cancellation was successful. Despite the cancellation, Samsung shipped not one, but two phones to my address.



No one was home at the time of delivery, and the courier left the packages on my doorstep. When I got home, the packages were gone and messaged Samsung on ebay the next day asking for a refunder. Their response was that the courier would never leave a package without a signature and that I must have received it. They refused to refund me and, in numerous messages, demanded that I pay for the second phone they sent.



They sent me a copy of the courier's report a few weeks later. The name on the report isn't mine, It's just random characters and the signature is just a random line. but Samsung continues to say I'm liable.



I've opened a case with eBay, but they sided with Samsung, citing the tracking information that says the packages were delivered. I went back and forth with Samsung for months, in my final message i sent video doorbell footage with timestamps of the courier leaving the packages.



A few days after sending the footage, I've now received an from a debt collection agency demanding payment for the second phone. I refuse to pay for a phone I didn't order and never received. What are my options now? Has anyone else dealt with a similar situation? How should I proceed? Any advice on how to handle the debt collectors and get Samsung to acknowledge their mistake would be greatly appreciated. 


Thief wasn't captured on video recording. We've recently had kids sneaking up from the side of the doorbell and crouching under the camera to play ding ding ditch - assuming something similar was done here too.

My car insurance provider is seeming shady,0,1mi5px3,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mi5px3/my_car_insurance_provider_is_seeming_shady/,2025-08-05 05:40:09,Strong-Zer0,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mi5px3/my_car_insurance_provider_is_seeming_shady/,"Location: UK

I'm with 1st Central as my car insurance provider, had no issues during my 1st year but ever since the end of the 1st year things have been really strange and suspicious.

A list of what happened in order:

- I want to amend my address and policy coverage, I knew there was a fee but doing it online was cheaper. Tried several times for 3 weeks to adjust but got error messages each time
- Therefore had to ring through and do it, being charged over triple the amount to do so
- any time I call them I get cut off or hung up on during the hold section. They take my details, put me on hold for a minute or so, then the call drops. 
- finally got through thanks to someone manually connecting me through their online chat team


Now the renewal happened, they quoted me £360 ISH for the year if I paid in one go. I activated automatic renewal to lock in that price

Then, the morning of the 27th I get an email at 10:45 saying they were unable to renew me and tried to warn me it would expire at midnight on the 26th, meaning if I HAD driven that day it would have been illegally. 

Now, I renewed (stupidly) and they charged me £550 instead of the offered £350, but I bit the bullet. Now my sensor has arrived but won't sync, and my family are all getting emails about how they need to register for the app even though we've all done so

Fast forward to today, I've been trying to call them 6 times and the same cutoff happens every time. I want to cancel my policy but the website has no option to do so despite advertising that it does, I feel totally stuck and I only have 6 days left on my 14 day cooling off period ","A list of what happened in order:

On June 13, 2025, $78.50 was withdrawn from my bank account on a non-chase ATM in Sacramento, CA, which incurred an additional $3 fee. that was all the money i had. I suspect my card was skimmed. When i reported this to chase after i had discovered this later on during a routine check of my purchases, they said they would investigate. not even a week later they told me i had authorized the purchase, and had \*permanently\* closed the case. Obviously pissed off at this, i took the notice to the bank and explained the situation: I live in Orange, and cannot/did not travel. I am a stay-at-home caretaker for my granny with no driver's license or job, and the small amount of money i receive is crucial to me. i get groceries on my bike. I take the bus locally. i CANNOT have been to Sacramento.

They completely and utterly dismissed me. I asked advice from a friend, who said to make a police report and bring it in. I did that as well as report to the CFPB and the FTC after further frustrations. Even after this, Chase INSISTS that I made the withdrawal because it was chip-based. I never lost my card. I still have the one that was copied.

What can i do about the bank literally enabling fraud? Has anyone else experienced this or similar? IS there anything i can do? Mom told me that small claims is for interpersonal disputes and no lawyer would take a case over such a paltry amount of coin.","When i reported this to chase after i had discovered this later on during a routine check of my purchases, they said they would investigate.

Parties Involved: Myself (not on the lease, but listed as a guest), my girlfriend (leaseholder), and our roommate (leaseholder, employee of the apartment office; his brother is the apartment manager)

Our roommate has violated our lease several times and has been notified by my girlfriend and I of our discomfort with each violation 

Violations by Roommate:
	•	Left marijuana, ash, and cigar wrappers on shared kitchen counters.
	•	Installed a security camera inside the unit without notifying tenants.
	•	Played excessively loud music audible from the ground floor (we reside on the 3rd floor).
	•	Knocked over our trash can and left garbage on the floor while leaving for work.

We documented these incidents with photos and communicated concerns to him each time. After continued issues and being ignored, we submitted a formal unit change request outlining the above behavior. And in retaliation he issued false violations and warnings towards me and my girlfriend 

False Claims Against Us:
	•	Unauthorized Tenant: I am not on the lease, but I am officially on the guest list, and I comply with the rule allowing six nights per week. This was confirmed as not a violation by the apartment manager (his brother).
	•	Unauthorized Pets: We do not own or have pets in the unit. This claim was false.

These warnings were never posted to the resident portal and appear to have been filed in retaliation after our unit change request because although we did not receive the warnings we did receive a blank lease violation alert with no reasoning attached. (he was definitely aware we knew we did not break the lease agreements)


Incident Details:
Following the unit change request, our roommate sent a threatening message to my girlfriend stating I had to be out by 10:30 PM or police would be called and I would be trespassed. That evening:
	•	He was intoxicated and loudly discussing with someone on the phone that I would be removed.
	•	My girlfriend, feeling unsafe, called the police. The roommate also called them.
	•	When police arrived, they found marijuana in plain sight and ordered him to dispose of it but took no further action.
	•	After officers left, the roommate again demanded I leave by 10:30 or “someone” would come and “take me out” when asked who he said “dont worry they’ll be here. My girlfriend refused, and he stormed out.
	•	My sister and her friend came to support us and found him in his brother’s car outside, and found that he had filed false wanrings.","Location: Texas, USA

My ex manipulated the system and a substance abuse evaluation and had supervised visits lifted. The GAL recommended visits stay at two hours, but the commissioner gave him a 60-day “trial run” with statutory minimum parent-time—despite a protective order and mountains of evidence. Our next hearing is Sept 30, and the commissioner has already discussed awarding him the 50/50 custody he requested. Every motion and affidavit my ex has filed, I have been able to prove it was a lie and provide evidence. My ex has only uploaded a sworn affidavit in his defense .. not a single bit of evidence. He is fighting out of spite, not actual best interest.

He went from 2 hours a week to 3 hrs on a weekday and weekends and holidays with our 18-month-old, who’s never spent a night away from me nor had anyone else providing for him. I have recordings, photos, texts, and financial records showing his abuse, alcoholism, suicidal thoughts, lack of parenting knowledge, and where I was the one 100% providing for our son, while splitting half of all the bills—but none of it was reviewed.

The court seems to think he’s “safe” just because he didn’t physically hurt our son—even though he hit me, drank daily, and neglected his child for over a year while we lived together and still neglecting. He has offered No child support, even though finally being ordered last week to pay. I even have a recording of him saying he “forgot” to help because he was “too busy.” I ultimately recorded out of fear, in it relationship, there was not a thing “staged”.

Now my son is being forced into overnights with someone he barely knows, and who doesnt know what to do with him and I’m terrified. It feels like no one is actually listening or paying attention to the best interest of the child.

I feel like I need more help in this situation than my attorney can offer, or am I missing something here?!?

Daughter 17F taken advantage of in unofficial job + separate child abuse,12,1mhyi8a,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhyi8a/daughter_17f_taken_advantage_of_in_unofficial_job/,2025-08-04 22:28:02,roflawful,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhyi8a/daughter_17f_taken_advantage_of_in_unofficial_job/,"Hi all, thanks in advance for the advice.

Location: California

Daughter (17F) needed a summer job. We had a good relationship with the owner of her after school child care program when she was ~8-11. He offered her a summer ""volunteer position"" which he said would result in community service hours & an unofficial ""allowance"" which he talked up as a ""big chunk"" of money (no specific figures) to help with college. If things went well, he often offers a payroll position at the end of the program. The community service sounded good for her college application, and some $ helps too. 

Given our positive prior relationship, I allowed this arrangement in good faith. I regret that decision.

She worked 6h/day, 3d/wk, 8 weeks. Roughly 130 hours all said and done. Set schedule, never late aside from 1 sick day. Clocked in & out as all standard employees did. Was given the same responsibilities as other employees. 

After the first 2 weeks, we inquired about the allowance, and he replied that it would be paid at the end of the summer. Over time, she noticed some severe cost cutting and shady/illegal practices going on with the business. She also had more responsibilities piled on over time. Some children are special needs which she has no training for. Her recent shift she was solely in charge of 14 children aged 5-6. I tried to look up the legality of this, and ratios seem in line, but I could not tell if her being a minor & not technically employed would affect anything. We thought she'd be more of a ""teacher's aide"" rather than a primary caretaker. Even if not illegal, I'm sure parents would not be thrilled if they knew the conditions.

This is her last scheduled week. Today, I talked to the owner, starting with general ""how is she doing? are you happy with her performance?"" etc. Everyone's happy with her work. I then hammered hard for a number/estimate on the ""allowance"" for her college planning purposes. The man would not give me a number. I also asked about the 501c3 status of this business or if he had some other organization with non profit status that some of her hours contributed to. Lots of words with no good answer.

She has 2 shifts left, with the last being this coming Friday. If he tries to pay her >$250 for her ~130 hours of labor I'd be shocked. 

He also made some comments about her number of hours that seemed 10-20% low for what she actually worked. Given the way this place is run, I would not be surprised if he's tampering with the time keeping. 

Not directly related, but more important: Also today, the art teacher confided in my daughter that 2 girls in another class were struck on the leg by their male teacher last week. The art teacher was afraid to speak up because this had happened before and the owner comes down on whoever speaks up. The children were afraid to tell their parents because they thought they'd get in trouble. Male teacher was sent home for the day and allowed to return to work today - the children were given candy to not share this information any more (!!!). Daughter approached the owner about this (she's very assertive) to make sure something was done. Owner said some misogynistic crap about women gossiping and how the teacher and children were just playing.  

Because the information reached daughter 3rd-hand, I don't know that she's in the best position directly escalate. She doesn't even know the names of the girls. She doesnt have contact info for the art teacher. I told her to user her remaining shifts to encourage the art teacher to escalate, share contact info, and to get the names of the girls affected and I could help find a way to inform their parents. The owner does what he can to isolate the individual employees, so the secretary with information about kids/parents does not know about the issue, and the teachers don't know parental information.


Summary of issues:

Daughter (and me) tricked into likely low pay ""community service"" position which is unlikely to be truly community service, or pay her more than $2/hr for her time.

General shady practices, some potentially illegal like putting 14 children under the care of a 17 year old. Pretty much guarantee he doesn't background check or ask about vaccination status or anything like that. Some days no break due to field trips. Some days held an extra 1-1.5 hours due to field trips. etc.

3rd hand report of abuse of girls at the hands of the teacher. Owner has trouble keeping employees, sweeps problems under the rug, punishes those who speak out.



I barely give a fuck about the pay at this point, but want my daughter to earn something fair for her time. If he kept up his end of the good will and paid her $10/hr I'd put that issue to bed. Let's assume he wont.

The physical violence against kids is the biggest problem. The fact that my daughter doesn't even know their names seems like it would be challenge to escalate legally, and I wouldn't know where to advise her to start. What is our best course of action here?

Thank you.","He offered her a summer ""volunteer position"" which he said would result in community service hours & an unofficial ""allowance"" which he talked up as a ""big chunk"" of money (no specific figures) to help with college.

I’ve collected substantial documentation, and I’m now actively seeking a labor attorney to explore potential legal action.

However, the intake process has been far from easy. I’ve been repeatedly turned down during the case review phase by several law firms. I’ve also spoken with various advocacy and regulatory organizations, but many of the issues I’ve raised involve overlapping jurisdictions or complexities they’re unable to manage directly. Several advised me that this is the kind of case best pursued with legal representation.

While I don’t believe my case lacks merit; especially given the volume and clarity of the evidence I’ve compiled, I understand that the scale of the company involved may present a challenge for lawyers due to resource constraints or potential risk.

But if what I’ve experienced falls outside what lawyers typically prioritize; if it’s more than just a legal matter, I wonder:
How can we expose and correct structural problems inside large corporations where certain groups have effectively privatized power under the guise of management?
How do we prevent this from happening again?

I’ve now faced so many rejections from attorneys that I feel completely disoriented about how to move forward.
If this system doesn’t even let us begin the fight; how are people supposed to believe that accountability exists at all?

Question: can I get in trouble for discussing my pay to my coworker?,1,1mhtnx9,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhtnx9/question_can_i_get_in_trouble_for_discussing_my/,2025-08-04 18:43:52,Willing-Profile-6264,1,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhtnx9/question_can_i_get_in_trouble_for_discussing_my/,"Location: Texas

Context: My coworker has been working at our company for over a year and makes $18/hr. The work that he does is different than what I do. For the sake of privacy I can’t go into specifics of what our job roles are. I just started and have been at the company for a little more than a month and make $20/hr. 

When I was shadowing my coworker to learn about what he does on his side of the building, he point blank asked me how much do I make. I was honest and said $20/hr. He then became visibly upset and said he was going to ask our boss for a raise. I agreed since he pretty much works his side and helps us on our side of the building when we get swamped or need help (which he doesn’t have to but he does), so I agreed. That was last week. Today, he came to me and asked me what my experience was. I told him what my experience consisted of, and he said that he was going to ask for a raise then. I told him that he was more than welcome to do that, and that if he could please not bring me into the conversation. He said that he wasn’t going to just yet. When he said “yet”, my heart lowkey sank and I asked what he meant by that. He said that he wanted to bring up the fact that I just started and get paid $20/hr and he’s been here for over a year and still makes $18/hr. I told him that maybe he could ask the boss how much technicians start off at and go from there so that way my name isn’t brought up. He stayed quiet and now I feel uneasy. 

Our company is super toxic and they do not hesitate to deduct people’s pay when they make mistakes. I am worried that my boss is going to pay me less to compensate paying him more. I am also worried that my boss is going to view me as problematic and think that I was somehow bragging about my pay despite my coworker asking me point blank. What should I do? Should I be legitimately concerned? I have thought about calling my supervisor and asking her for advice since she’ll be out of the office tomorrow, but I don’t know. 

I know discussing pay isn’t illegal, but can I get in trouble with my company? ","He then became visibly upset and said he was going to ask our boss for a raise.

My wife and I are getting divorced through mediation. We won’t hire lawyers.
We’re getting divorced because she found out I was watching porn and sexting with people online, sharing pics and videos of myself and video chatting. Always done behind closed doors if I was not alone at home or when I was alone. 
I did realize I had a porn and sexting addiction and am going through the 12 steps program. 
In my conversations I’d talk to people about maybe meeting someday and then I’d pull back because I didn’t want or wasn’t ready to actually do it. 
All of my behaviors were wrong and she has every right to feel like I cheated on her, period. 
I did talk hypothetically to a woman locally about meeting up when my wife went out of town. This was talked about in March, April for a trip my wife took in July. Nothing happened because we separated in April but my wife believes I would have gone through it and thinks it would be unsafe because I would have done it when my youngest son would be asleep. I told this person if we did this, it would have to be after he’s asleep. 
So my wife is saying she wants to put in our parenting plan or divorce decree that I am not allowed to bring random sex partners to my place when our son is NOT with me. Can she dictate and is it enforceable what I do when my son is with her and I’m alone in my place? 
It seems like that would infringe on my personal freedom and liberty but I wanted to ask that question. ","Location: Tennessee

Okay so I bought a truck off if facebook marketplace (I know bad Idea). I went to meat the person selling it at a gas station where he (while wearing a dealership uniform) told me the truck was in great condition aside from some cosmetic issues. When I asked about the bumper having a huge dent he mentioned something about not having all the information and it looks like it was someone backing into something.

Now here is the bad parts, I ran the vin through the dealership my father works at to find out it had been in an accident in North Carolina and the airbags were deployed, and that was only the start. I reached out to find out any other issues only to be told it was consignment piece  and getting ahold of the owners would be hard.  He then ghosted me and I took a few months to find out that I needed a new engine and transmission. I had SCDOT do an investigation where they said that I would need to file with small claims court to hopefully get my money back. I also found out that the owner had used a third party from the dealership that they  bought the truck from for $1500 then sold it to me for $6400 doing nothing to it while knowing all the listed issues. They had the truck for a month and claimed that they had their shop look over it. It had a few hundred thousand miles on it so I expected issues but some people put new transmissions and engines after a while but no such luck for me. Had the truck for a month before I heard the engine knocking. And the trans started slipping. Sadly the dealership I took it to said they couldn’t find any issues when they did an inspection after I bought the truck. ( I did this a week or so after I had bought it).

I had court today and it turns out the real owners only had a clean title and carfax to say they did nothing wrong. Turns out carfax is in legal issues and I dont know what to do about this whole situation.

Hello friends,

Currently I'm enrolled in law school as a 3L in Louisiana. This past summer I took a road trip vacation. I bought 200mg total of THC edibles (legal from dispensary) in California. I left Cali with about 150mg left. An officer pulled me over in Texas on my way home to Louisiana because my plate ""wasn't showing up in his system at all."" He asked if I had drugs or weapons in the car, and stupidly assuming THC is legal in Texas like it is in my home of Louisiana, I told him about the edibles. He searched the car and took them, and of course found nothing else.

I now have a Class C ticket for possession of drug paraphernalia for 150mg of THC edibles. Will this ticket hurt my chances of employment or my character and fitness examinations, considering it was a small amount that I legally purchased, and had no intention of illegally consuming? Should I go to court and ask for leniency, or the DA to amend the charge? I've never dealt with this type of issue before.

I plan to move out of Louisiana to practice in a northern, more blue state if that helps. Oregon and Washington are my current prospects.

Thanks.","This past summer I took a road trip vacation. An officer pulled me over in Texas on my way home to Louisiana because my plate ""wasn't showing up in his system at all.""

Fiancé’s former employer paid him the wrong pay rate on final check after quitting,6,1mhnm6o,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhnm6o/fiancés_former_employer_paid_him_the_wrong_pay/,2025-08-04 14:45:07,Any_Garbage2598,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhnm6o/fiancés_former_employer_paid_him_the_wrong_pay/,"Location: Texas

Context: My fiancé put in his 2 weeks’ notice mid July by email and no one acknowledged it for several days. His manager finally saw the email and actually asked him to stay until September. He stayed, and then quit last week because he couldn’t take the stress of the job anymore (part of why he originally quit) Fast forward to last Friday his paycheck was about $1500 short. Turns out he was paid minimum wage (7.25) for 51 hours including paid out vacation. His plan was to hold on to company equipment (expecting them to pull something like this) until he got his final pay. He informed his former manager of this. And his manager said “It’s because you haven’t turned in the equipment” after doing a little bit of research it seems this is illegal. We’ve drafted an email to send to HR demanding his pay be corrected. Is this adequate and or are these grounds to pursue legal action? 



“To whom it may concern,

I am writing to formally demand immediate correction regarding my final paycheck. I was issued $250, which is grossly inaccurate. I worked 51 hours during my final pay period, at an agreed rate of $34 per hour, entitling me to $1,734 before taxes. The remaining $1,484 has not been paid.

I spoke with my former manager, who stated that payment would be issued overnight once company equipment was returned. The equipment was returned as requested, yet no further payment has been made.

Furthermore, withholding earned wages due to equipment return or any other reason is unlawful. According to the Texas Payday Law (Texas Labor Code, Chapter 61.018):

“An employer may not withhold or divert any part of an employee’s wages unless the employer is ordered to do so by a court, required or authorized by state or federal law, or the employee has expressly authorized the deduction in writing.”

No such court order or written authorization exists in this case. You are legally obligated to pay all wages earned at the agreed-upon rate, regardless of any administrative processes or return of equipment. These are separate matters and cannot legally be tied to wage disbursement.

If the full outstanding amount of $1,484 is not paid within 5 business days, I will file formal complaints with both the Texas Workforce Commission and the U.S. Department of Labor to enforce my rights under the law.

Please confirm receipt of this email and provide a written timeline for resolution”

I just got out of my first apartment which had very scammy landlords. They only speak Spanish and have very little knowledge needed to legally rent apartments. We have had many problems where we have had to tell them the law. 

We left the apartment very clean, it ended up being better than how they left it to us when we first moved in. They still claimed it was ""dirty"" behind the fridge and a few other things that were not our fault. They originally charged us $400 but we pushed back. They changed it to $150 and we still thought it was too much for some dust behind the fridge and pushed for only $50 off the deposit. They never responded back. 

It seems they sent us our deposit though through the mail to our address without telling us or giving tracking. USPS needed a signature, no one knew to be there, and so we were given a slip to order a redelivery or go to the post office to pick it up. 

We just went to the post office to ask for our certified mail but they said they couldnt find it. The redelivery option online says ""sorry, this service is currently unavailable"". I don't believe the lady at the post office will find it despite telling us she'd call if she did. 

It is still within 30 days since the end of my lease. What are my next steps to ensure I receive my deposit back? Do I email the landlords telling them USPS did not deliver it? I don't want to wait too long in hopes USPS finds it. 

These landlords are very difficult and I am worried when we tell them we never received the check that they will refuse to send another. ","They originally charged us $400 but we pushed back.

I guess I just want to know if there's anything I can do to get our RAW photos or if I'm really just waiting for her to find the time.

OH! And if I request an updated contract, if she asks for a fee of any kind is that ... illegal? Or is that what I should just do and if she can't live up to that due date, I can actually take legal action.

Over the past month, I have had a wiring issue with my AC, a thermostat issue, and most recently the outside AC fan motor went out. It is always something. 

Wall of text incoming, my apologies.

For reference if needed this is a 2 story townhouse, 2 bed 2 bath. Each building is four separate units. There are roughly 45 buildings on the property. Some of the units have newer, larger AC units. To make matters worse on me, the property manager and the maintenance tech are spread over FOUR local properties all owned by the owner, so I never know when I will get a fix. They have had apprentices come out here, who are by themselves and have no knowledge, one even disconnected the wrong line. All this because the owner refuses to hire anyone else.

The place that I rent has come under new owners and the quality of care has gone down significantly. The owner is telling the property manager and maintenance to not replace the AC unit, to just do simple repairs but all repairs fail to fix the problem for more than a few days. For instance they came out this morning to work on it, claimed they fixed it, then it was out 4 hours later, and I am currently sweating while they twiddle their thumbs. The maintenance tech himself has said he tried to request the actual owner of the property to buy a new AC unit for my unit and they won't, they instead try to offer a window unit, which I still haven't seen. A window unit won't cool this entire place but it's a start, if they followed through. 

When the air has went out, it gets around 85 to 90 in my unit. I'm at my wits end. I have lost sleep and been stressed. I am wondering what my legal avenues are. I know that in my state AC is not necessarily a given thing, but the implied warranty of habitability could be brought up, as the first four years I rented here, the AC unit was always kept in working order and maintained, and every unit here has central air. 

No, the AC is not stated to be included in the lease, but there is a clause that says the landlord is liable if acting in negligence when it comes to repairing or lack of repairing appliances, plumbing, heating or air. There is no outline of included amenities, just that we pay the electric bill. Could my landlord refusing to replace the unit, knowing it is faulty and keeps breaking down, be an act of negligence? Or refusing to hire more maintenance so that I could get repairs done in a timely manner?

I'm just trying to find out what to do. I'm not at a financial point where I can afford a hotel or any repairs and window units, so I'm at the mercy of my rights. My main concern with the heat is my health and my cat's health. For three to four nights on separate occasions over the month I have been without air, and not able to sleep. I have a CPAP machine and I have lost sleep during this and missed work due to this. I know it's a long shot but is there any financial resource?

I know this is a wall of text, I'm just trying to find out what my chances or rights are. I can't seem to find anything online for my county codes or city codes. I'm trying to find out who to call or where to look to find out more information. 

Thank you all. ","The owner is telling the property manager and maintenance to not replace the AC unit, to just do simple repairs but all repairs fail to fix the problem for more than a few days.

If you need a tldr let me know i will try to sum it up

  
I bought a vehicle in the state of New Jersey. I had come across this 2019 Subaru impreza for $14,785 on CarGurus. It had multiple features that made it more than worth it in my eyes. I called the dealership to confirm the price however they told me that Car gurus sets their own price not the dealership. ( I later found  out this was false and the dealership inputs all of the information manually) I settled on a price with the agent on the phone as well as an appointment date. ( $15,400 May 3rd) I got this vehicle financed through navy federal.

 A 6hr drive to the dealership later, the on-site salesman tried to sell me different vehicles, even though at this point i had already put a $500 deposit on the impreza. Their manager decided to tell me that they had already sold my vehicle to a different buyer and that there was nothing he could do. They kept pressuring me to buy a different vehicle so i decided to see what other options they may have had. When I got to their 2nd vehicle lot to inquire about another car I saw the impreza sitting there on the lot, it even had the same VIN. When i asked about this they said it was just ""awaiting delivery"". I was going to settle on a subaru legacy that I knew had issues but by that point I had been there for hours and couldn't leave without a vehicle. I tried to talk things over with the manager in order to get some kind of deal due to the fact that they had sold my vehicle and I had not gotten my deposit back. However the manager said they didn't owe me anything so i couldn't even get a decent deal. By the time I got to the finance department it was already close to 10pm.

 Thankfully the Finance guy came clean to me and told me they had not yet sold the vehicle but had gotten an offer paying $20,000 for the car so the salesmen were trying to make me buy a different car. (and potentially keep my deposit but i'm not sure on that) He helped me get the car I came for (at A $700 increase) but it wasn't until after the purchase I realized that some of the key features I was interested in weren't even on the car. not only that but my name is misspelled on almost every document I signed. They also told me that they would send me the title and register my vehicle in the state of NY, But now almost 4 months later they still have not sent anything to me. I've tried to contact them but they ignore my calls/voicemails and when i do get to contact them they tell me they will send it but nothing ever comes. I have even missed work due to my car now being unregistered.

  
I'm planning on contacting the NJ division of consumer affairs but i really don't know what my options are. I also don't know if i should seek some sort of compensation due to the fact that I have missed work and have not even gotten what i was promised. Any info helps thanks for reading and hopefully taking this seriously.

$50k in 3rd Party Property Disposed of by Management /Landlord Texas.,1,1mhkygj,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhkygj/50k_in_3rd_party_property_disposed_of_by/,2025-08-04 13:08:12,AlwaysWilling2Help,4,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhkygj/50k_in_3rd_party_property_disposed_of_by/,"Location: Texas

I have searched and can't find a case in Texas where the landlord was allowed to keep 3rd party's property.

No, the landlord has zero right to permanently keep third-party property in a Texas commercial warehouse if:

The landlord knows the third-party owner (e.g., through communication or mutual understanding).

The third party can prove ownership with receipts or other documentation (e.g., contracts, serial numbers, or affidavits).

Under Texas law, specifically Texas Property Code § 54.021, a landlord's lien applies only to the tenant's property, not third-party property, especially when ownership is clear and the landlord is aware of the third party's identity. A broad lien clause (e.g., ""Landlord may seize all property on the premises"") is unenforceable against third-party property in this scenario, and the landlord's knowledge of the owner eliminates any rare exceptions.

-

I had things in a friends warehouse. I spoke with the property manager, which I know because I have a unit in same park. They acknowledged/knew it was my property. I recently found out they were throwing it away. This is all new products that I resell. I immediately text the property manager regarding what is going on The person at that unit just told me they're cleaning it out and they were told a dispose of everything. The property manager responded with. - We had a deal You were supposed to catch up on your rent and I would allow you to get your property. You haven't caught up on your rent. We own the property now. -
My unit has nothing to do with my friend unit. In fact it appears that they've been illegally holding my property while I was struggling to catch up on the rent. Since the property was very valuable. Why wouldn't they have an auction? Plus I had probably three hundred package returns either in boxes with multiple items in it or the brown style envelope returns. Apparently they disposed them too and all that mail they were unopened. As far as I can see a landlord has no right to any property except for the tenants. Since they knew it was mine, they never notified me, It appears that they held my property illegally by using my being behind on rent to hold onto it. They acknowledge the same day that the stuff was being removed that it was my property but it is now theirs. I would like to add that when when I texted them I said I'm here right now I can get it out. I also stated how much it was worth. In the reply they did not dispute my comment about the value or call it anything like just garbage. I do have pictures and video that I took of my stuff prior. --- Am I missing something in the regarding the law.","A broad lien clause (e.g., ""Landlord may seize all property on the premises"") is unenforceable against third-party property in this scenario, and the landlord's knowledge of the owner eliminates any rare exceptions.

Hello I’ve been working as server for firebirds for going on 4 years. The absolute unprofessionalism and disregard for their employees is disgusting. About 3 years ago my friends and I went out after work, our manager was there. He’s been sexually harassing me for a year at that point. When we were out he came up from behind me and licked my ear. I froze and spit my drink out of my mouth out of shock. My coworker stood up for me and snapped on him. He then responded with maybe if you didn’t talk to other guys your schedule would be better. (He was in charge of my schedule) . I reported it to hr they had him take me in the office alone and give me a fake apology. They PROMOTED the man that licked my ear to head chef and moved him to back of house months after the incident.Ever since then they have been targeting me .  The one who licked my ear when he manages will make it so I don’t get tables. The other manager caught him multiple times and reported it to hr themselves and they have done nothing. Tax season came around and I realized my taxes I wrote down they put into the computer wrong . Chris the one who licked my ear said you’re right they did put it in wrong I’ll change it for you. Fast forward it never got changed and I owed the irs around 10,000 because of their incompetence, or spite? I asked my other manager if it got switched and he said I’m sorry I don’t know why he would tell you he changed it he doesn’t have that power to . We got a new manager Jen that Chris got close with and she also targets me now . My one manager asked her to sit down and talk with me and she said I refuse due to legal issues? Jen allowed someone’s mom to come in the restraunt to confront me and seemed like she wanted to fight me about telling their daughter to do her side work.  My manger quit because he said “Anna they’re literally obviously targeting you at this point hr and the district managers don’t care about you. “ he eventually quit because of it. The district manager said he would have Jen and I sit down because a manager can’t refuse to talk to an employee. It never happened. He also said in passing I heard Chris licked your ear EW. Right after he had that conversation with me he told Chris he was going to make him my manager again. There’s so much that has happened on top of this. I make a note anytime something happens. I have witnesses. Everyone there even managers, tell me they feel bad for me and that it’s obvious. No one can understand why hr hasn’t done anything. I’ve called hr so many times. When I call now my number is automatically forwarded to voicemail. They have done so many illegal things I don’t understand how it’s just accepted by the higher ups. They’ve illegally clocked people out while they were still working. They make us tip out the bartenders and host but don’t make them perform the tasks we tip them out for.

Slander/ libel help,1,1mhk2vg,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhk2vg/slander_libel_help/,2025-08-04 12:37:12,elyats,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhk2vg/slander_libel_help/,"Hello! 

I am wondering if I have a case against a party for slander/ libel. 

About a year and a half ago I had cut a friend off because they were making life choices that I didn’t agree with. 
Since then: they have separated from their husband/ put my family’s name in their divorce write up. 
We are still friends with their ex, and on the weeks they have their child they agreed that the child can not come to our home until the child is a certain age. 
The ex friend is claiming via text and to the negotiator that myself and husband are unfit parents and that we are “negligent and immature”. None of this is true. The ex is also now attempting to make it so their kid is not allowed around myself or spouse under any circumstance. 

I was at first going to ignore it, but over the last weekend they have called the cops to “check on us” while we were at dinner at a brewery becuase they felt “their child was unsafe”. (We were there for maybe 3 hours? Kids running around having a great time, adults hanging out, everyone home by 830). And they also proceeded to make more claims that my spouse and I are putting the child in danger.

Texas tenant help needed,2,1mhid96,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhid96/texas_tenant_help_needed/,2025-08-04 11:35:13,bodaciousbmoney,2,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mhid96/texas_tenant_help_needed/,"Hey, everyone. 👋 Long time listener, first time caller. 

Location: Austin, TX

Tl;dr: the brand new apartments I’m living in were poorly insulated when they were built, so dozens of tenants are complaining about excessive noise. What are my options in Texas? Does this qualify for some kind of class action suit? I’m in this lease for another year. 

I live in a new apartment complex in Austin, Texas (moved in Nov. 2024). The complex is mostly wonderful except for one giant issue: neighbor noise. I knew immediately when someone finally moved in above me (around April 2025) because the noise was immediate and incessant. There’s the normal human noise (furniture moving, walking, voices, slamming doors), but there’s also this consistent, almost mechanical sounding “thudding.” 

Back in early June, family visited and advised that I put in a maintenance request because the “thudding” could be an appliance or even a water/piping issue. I started recording at that point to be able to provide more insight to the maintenance crew. At the same time, I began emailing the leasing office letting them know about the noise and they responded asking me to submit a maintenance request. 

Maintenance stopped by my apartment a few days after I submitted the work order and let me know they 1) inspected the apartment above me and 2) spoke with the tenant, and they concluded nothing was wrong. They advised me to begin filing complaints with the leasing office. I let them know that it was the leasing office who told me to submit a maintenance request. They were obviously irritated by that and said something along the lines of “why would they tell you to do that - they’re the ones who have to deal with all these noise issues.” It seemed like the maintenance worker caught himself there because he even alluded to his own issue with his upstairs neighbor (this all happened quickly and I should have recorded the convo, but they stopped by unexpectedly. I don’t remember precisely what was said - but it felt as though he knew he said too much).

Since then, I have sent emails just about every other day asking for next steps and advice on what to do about the noise. I’ve recorded 30 different times in which the “thudding” sound has occurred (for hours on end, day and night), and sent it to the office. 

They said, in writing, that they have approval from their parent company to allow me to move apartments. They did not clarify 1) if I would have to pay for the moving expenses or 2) why I would be moved instead of my noisy neighbor. They answer me about once every other week and do not answer or return my phone calls. I’ve tried to visit in person twice but the manager wasn’t there (the office hours are also during my work schedule so dropping by in person is difficult when I’m in meetings all day).

Last week, I finally left a one-star review on Google and that’s when I discovered SEVEN other negative reviews that also mentioned the noise and lack of communication from the office. I ran into a neighbor today and asked if she has noise issues. Get this: THEY MOVED HER FROM A DIFFERENT BUILDING TO THE THIRD FLOOR OF OUR BUILDING!!!! This is a chronic issue across the whole complex and they’re just moving people around instead of dealing with it head on!!!!!! 

So, experts, what are my options? What should I do? I’m in this lease until spring 2026 and I LOVE this apartment!!! The amenities are amazing, the layout is great, and I love the neighborhood. But the noise is diabolical. It’s beyond disturbing - I’m losing sleep over it and I’m becoming a total Karen, banging on my own ceiling trying to get my neighbors to shut up. HELP.

I bought my 2016 Mazda cx5 about 3 years ago. About a year or so after I took it to a car dealer that was doing a promotion to win a prize and while there I looked at trading it in (the guy was very interested in it) during the prices they ran a CarFax and told me that my car had sustained damages that amounted to over $50,000 in repairs. Looking up the laws here it's illegal to sell a vehicle without notifying that it's a salvaged title. My question though is if there's no salvaged title (which it doesn't seem like there is) are they still liable for not telling me about the damages, which i feel they should know about since they should have checked that out before putting it on the lot? I plan on calling them today and see what they say. I've also contacted a lawyer to get advice but IDK how long that will take so figured I'd get some advice here.

Installing a gas line

Painting the fence

Now it may seem silly to some but honestly feels inconsiderate and feels like a violation to my rights as a tenant not have to my landlord show up randomly with no prior notice to me and only the the bottom unit renter. 

Her changes blocked my driveway access, messed up the gravel driveway I use to install the gas line, and now not having access to the yard my dog goes into to paint it.

location: PA

I posted yesterday about a new landlord buying our apartment a little less than a month from when we signed a new year lease with our previous rental company. He emailed my husband and I saying he needed to complete a new lease with us, as ‘the lease we signed was now invalid because of the sale.’

When I posted yesterday, I received reassurance that he would need to honor our lease for that year, it would still be valid for the dates it was approved, and he could not raise our rent. 

When we spoke with the new owner, he said for it to ‘make sense,’ he was raising our rent $200 a month. He is also charging us $200/mo to use one side of the two car garage that was included for free with the original owners. When I said we researched and our lease would still be valid after the sale, he basically laughed and said that’s not true. He does this ‘all the time’ and His lawyer told him the lease was invalid upon sale. (But odd that I googled his name to see if there were any reviews of other properties he owns and not a single thing showed up about being a landlord). He also said his insurance would not accept the lease from our rental company. (This company is very well known in our town and the lease is meticulous). He gave us 10 days to make our decision. Also he did not provide an entire new lease, just a single sheet of paper with the new prices but that may be because he wants our decision first.

So how do we go about telling him, again, that this is illegal? Do we ask him to have a conference call with his lawyer? We haven’t got one yet but I work for one who I’m sure would help if I asked. I really don’t want to be a pain and cause issues but the timing of everything and his confidence he can do this doesn’t make sense to us. I also don’t want him to decide to evict us after we sign the lease if we object to him raising our rent. It’s not that we can’t pay it but it’s BS he’s raising it lol.

Thank you all for your help!","location: PA

Lately, my employer has been delaying commission payments by more than 2 months given “platform errors” and “corrections”. I’ve even inquired formally through the platform we use, and they blatantly acknowledge they’ll be delayed without apology.

I’m still employed there, but I’m starting to feel like this is wage theft.

Does this count as a violation of California labor law?
Should I start with a Labor Commissioner claim or go straight to a lawyer?

I have all my pay statements and commission records. I want to get my money without making a dumb legal move. Any advice or experience with this would be super appreciated!

We bought a 2022 Hyundai Palisade on Friday. The whole situation was super sketchy, the salesmen was terrible and shady, the finance guy kept confusing us and gaslighting us when we questioned him about numbers and the car wouldn’t even start after we signed the contract.

When the salesman took it to the service center to check it out, they said they couldn’t replicate the issue I described and that it was probably fine. As I was waiting, I started researching the issue we experienced hoping it’s something small and read back to back Reddit and Facebook posts of people saying they had the same issue with their palisade except it’s happening to them while they’re driving, a few people said it happened in the middle of a turn in a busy intersection, multiple people said it happened while driving at high speeds on the highway and every single person said they took it to the dealership, the dealership could “replicate” or fix the issue and I start having a full on panic attack.

I have pretty severe driving anxiety because of past accidents and just pretty severe anxiety in general especially after having kids and it was a big deal for me to have a car that was newer and had certain safety features which is why we spent so much more for this car than a car that would’ve probably been easier to have financed. I knew that there was no way I’d ever feel safe driving a car that could just randomly stall on the highway with my one and two year old in the back.

So the sales manager comes over to us and says he personally drove it and didn’t see anything wrong so we could take the car home or if “it would make me feel better” they could keep it for the weekend to see if it does it again. I told him that I didn’t feel safe driving a car on the highway with my two babies that could potentially stall like that which could risk our lives and would like to cancel my contract and he told me that I signed the contract saying I was taking the car “as is” and he’d do us the courtesy of trying to fix the car over the weekend but other than that, it wasn’t his problem.

He kept bringing up that we were lucky that we got the warranty and I told him that I didn’t think the contract could be upheld because this major issue that makes the car undriveable was not disclosed when we signed the contract and he said that he just drove it and there is no problem with it.

Unfortunately, I’m sure he’s right that legally there’s nothing he has to do but I honestly do believe they knew of this issue before and that’s why they were so easy to bring the price down when I thought the car was a good deal already.

Now, on top of everything else, I was looking through the contract that we signed on the tablet while the finance guy was scrolling as fast as possible and whenever I asked what it was saying, he’d say something like “oh it’s just bank stuff” or “insurance stuff” and didn’t have a chance to read, hoping to find anything that could get us out of it before they try to drop this ticking time bomb off at my house and never talk to me again when I see that the total amount that we financed was a lot more than I was expecting.

I assumed it was the warranty that we got scammed into but then I see the breakdown of the cost which includes dealer fees and doc fees and lien fees, which I had anticipated, then I see the warranty which is actually $4000, so just slightly over the $3900 we were originally quoted but then at the top the purchase price of the car is over $3000 more than the listed price and the price we were given.

During the warranty negotiations, we asked him about why it was 78 instead of 72 months like we had been originally told and he said it was to keep the monthly payment within our budget, but it was actually that they just added 6 extra months of payments and increased the cars price.

(ETA: I now believe they were intentionally misleading/lying to us because without the warranty added, the original price of the vehicle and the one they put in the contract is almost exactly the same monthly payment when they increased the term from 72 to 78 months so they kept presenting us with monthly payment options instead of totals because we wouldn’t notice the $2 difference)

Also the only reason we got the warranty was because he told us the manufacturers warranty was expired for the powertrain even though online it said it was a 10 year/100k mile warranty and the car only had 80k miles and he said it was because when you buy a used car, it actually cuts the original warranties in half so it expired at 50k miles but I’ve never had that happen before when buying a car or heard of that being a thing. So now on top of not even having a car that is drivable (in my opinion I guess), they also scammed us into paying $7000 more including the warranty that I’m still not even sure we needed.

I know we signed the contract and we should’ve done a better job of stopping him from scrolling and reading every line but he straight up lied to us when we specifically asked multiple times about the payments being significantly different and we have in writing the deal that we made with the salesman so is there anything we can do at this point??

I really don’t want the car at all anymore which is so sad because it’s literally my dream car (minus the terrifying engine issue) so would I like the contract to just be canceled but at the very least if we are forced to keep the car, is there anyway to get the contract corrected to the price we were told we would be paying? Like this seems beyond just scammy and more like legitimate fraud? Please please help us, I know it’s our fault for not being more thorough but any advice would be so incredibly appreciated. I’m also going to try cross posting to get the most advice as soon as possible before they deliver this $30000 mistake tomorrow. Thanks in advance!","So the sales manager comes over to us and says he personally drove it and didn’t see anything wrong so we could take the car home or if “it would make me feel better” they could keep it for the weekend to see if it does it again. I told him that I didn’t feel safe driving a car on the highway with my two babies that could potentially stall like that which could risk our lives and would like to cancel my contract and he told me that I signed the contract saying I was taking the car “as is” and he’d do us the courtesy of trying to fix the car over the weekend but other than that, it wasn’t his problem. He kept bringing up that we were lucky that we got the warranty and I told him that I didn’t think the contract could be upheld because this major issue that makes the car undriveable was not disclosed when we signed the contract and he said that he just drove it and there is no problem with it. (ETA: I now believe they were intentionally misleading/lying to us because without the warranty added, the original price of the vehicle and the one they put in the contract is almost exactly the same monthly payment when they increased the term from 72 to 78 months so they kept presenting us with monthly payment options instead of totals because we wouldn’t notice the $2 difference)

Hey guys, this is a long story so I’m going to try to make this quick and just include pertinent information. 

My mother in law is a single mom who currently resides with her 12 year old daughter, all her other kids are well into their 20s. 

She met a man online and invited him to move in with her and her daughter in 2022, much to the family’s dismay. 

Eventually they started a romantic relationship and not long after, this new man began to domestically abuse my mother in law. My sister in law was made to lie to us about it at first, she witnessed some key events, and even had to call the police 3 times in fear for her and her mother’s life. 

Eventually, after the man threatened to beat my sister in law, my mother in law finally filed for a PFA order against him. However, the man is a leech on her and had nothing to his name and became homeless as a result of it. 

Over time he sweetened my mother in law back up and gradually went from sleeping in his truck on their driveway and using their bathroom, to fully living in the home again. My sister in law was once again made to lie to us about this fact until we found out. 

My SIL flew in to visit us and on the last day before we flew her back she had an hour and a half long panic attack saying that she doesn’t feel safe in that house with him and that her mom doesn’t listen to her. 

When we came back, I walked down the stairs and recorded him sleeping the basement and in no uncertain terms told him to kick rocks. My MIL let him back in later on that day so I called the police to report him in violation. That was today and he is currently in custody. My MIL is very angry at me, has been very selfish, and even told me flat out that she is going to lie to the judge and try to withdraw the PFA entirely. 

Knowing this, I cannot in good conscience let my SIL live there anymore. He’s not there now but I can’t trust my MIL to not let him back in the future. Here’s the evidence we have: 

Recorded instances and police reports of the many times they came on the domestic violence calls 

The PFA as well as footage of it being broken

My wife telling the officers responding to the recent call today that the mom will likely lie, and then her actually lying on the body camera footage before being found out. 

Recording of SIL panic attack. 

Testimony of 7 family members who all feel she is unsafe in the home with her mother in the current state. 

Testimony of SIL saying the same 

My question is, do my wife and I even have a case to begin with? What can we do to strengthen it? Any advice is much appreciated, I feel pretty helpless right now, but I know that can’t be true.

Horrible Greystar move out experience,2,1mh12lh,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mh12lh/horrible_greystar_move_out_experience/,2025-08-03 20:59:24,Calm_Egg1928,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mh12lh/horrible_greystar_move_out_experience/,"Location: Texas

Hi everyone — I’m looking for feedback or similar experiences dealing with Greystar in Texas.

I moved out of a Greystar-managed apartment on September 30, 2024. There was no written move-out inspection — just a brief walk-through where someone from the office said, “You’re good to go.” I had completed a move-in inspection when I first leased, but no final documentation was provided when I moved out.

Then on October 25 2024, I received a post-move invoice from them claiming I owed money for:
- Wall marks/smudges
- Carpet cleaning (they sent no pics, but there was no damage just needed some routine cleaning)
- A crack above the doorframe

They included some photos, including one showing a crack above the top of a doorframe. The crack happened because nails under the carpet weren’t fully hammered in, causing the floor to push up against the door when it was closed. We didn’t notice the issue right away because the door stayed open most of the time. When we realized what was happening, we called maintenance, and they came to fix the flooring. I don’t recall seeing a crack above the door after the repair, and it wasn’t something we had been aware of.

I disputed the charges with Greystar, explaining that:
- The wall marks were minor
- The flooring/doorframe issue was caused by their installation/maintenance problem
- Their own lease states you’ll only be charged for cleaning/repairs if something is “soiled beyond normal wear”

They disagreed — but did not immediately send it to collections. I made a good-faith effort to resolve it, but after some time, I found out they had turned it over to a debt collection agency.

I’m frustrated because:
- There was no final walkthrough report
- I was told verbally at move-out that everything looked fine
- The wall and carpet issues fall under normal wear and tear
- The doorframe crack stemmed from a maintenance defect
- Despite trying to resolve it, they still sent it to collections
- This is now affecting me financially even though I was cooperative

What I’m asking:
1. Is this worth fighting legally? (Small claims court in Texas?)
2. Can I successfully dispute this with the collection agency?
3. Does the lease clause about “soiled beyond normal wear” give me any leverage?
4. Has anyone else dealt with Greystar charging for basic turnover or wear?
5. Should I file a complaint with the Texas Attorney General or CFPB?

SN:
They also still owe me $250 from a resident referral bonus. I signed a form in 2023 agreeing to a $500 referral, and they only ever sent me one check for $250. 

Would love to hear your thoughts or advice. This whole situation feels off, and I’m trying to protect myself and hold them accountable if possible.

Is there anything I can do to help my siblings-in-law?,0,1mguuhg,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mguuhg/is_there_anything_i_can_do_to_help_my/,2025-08-03 16:16:42,AftonTheMom,8,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mguuhg/is_there_anything_i_can_do_to_help_my/,"Location: Utah

My husband grew up with a very controlling mother. The classic ""I'm the mom, so I'm always right"" kind of parent. We all know the type. But ever since my husband started dating me during his senior year of high school, things have gotten a lot worse.

For a little bit more context, my husband has seven siblings, six of them younger. The youngest is currently 3 years old. My mother-in-law doesn't work. She does ""projects,"" which often involve her to be away from the house. My father-in-law pays for the house that they rent even though she kicked him out five years ago. My in-laws are NOT legally separated or divorced. They just live separately and my FIL pays for his wife to live in the house that he's renting while he lives in his parents' basement.

When my husband was eight-years-old, his mother had a miscarriage. I've had miscarriages as well, so I understand the pain. It's heart wrenching. She blamed the miscarriage on my then eight-year-old husband. To this day, he carries guilt for the death of his unborn sibling. According to him, the reason that he got the blame was because he was ""rebelling"" at that time. An eight-year-old. Rebellious enough to cause a miscarriage. ""Sometimes God gives us gifts,"" she had said to him. ""And sometimes He takes them away.""

She had six kids at the time. She stopped taking care of them when she miscarried. My husband is the one who stepped up to cook dinner for his four younger siblings throughout this time. His mother was too grief-stricken, and his father was too busy ""supporting his wife."" From what I've heard, my MIL cared more for her hyper-realistic baby doll that she bought after the miscarriage than her six living children. 

As the children grew, and even more were added, my husband took on more and more responsibility of his younger siblings. Whenever he wasn't at work or school, he tended to them. Even after my husband moved in with me, he was expected to babysit his siblings for free. It wouldn't be a problem if they had asked him to babysit, but they didn't. They expected and relied on him to care for his baby siblings full time with no compensation. 

Another thing you need to know before we get into the main issue is that my in-laws have joined a cult. If you live in Utah, you may have heard of ""Impact Training."" On the surface, it seems to be a type of group therapy or confidence building course. But the more I learned about it, the more apparent it became that it is simply a destructive, life-ruining organization that has caused my in-laws to be away from home even more than they were before.

Now, my husband and I have our own place and a baby of our own. We used to visit his family whenever we were invited, which was maybe every other week. My husband also started running every Saturday morning with his seventeen-year-old brother. Over the following weeks and months, we started hearing and witnessing more and more things that made us question if we should intervene.

To start off, my husband and I had an event at the end of June at a place of worship in our religion. Afterward, we were taking family pictures, and my six-year-old BIL was reluctant to participate. My FIL picked him up and carried him behind us to get in place for the picture. My 6yo BIL was crying, but he stopped very suddenly. I didn't think much of it until my mom and my sister both told me after the event what had happened. Apparently, my FIL shook his 6yo son to get him to stop crying, and it worked. Keep in mind that we are in public, in a place of worship, no less. We don't have proof, but we are confident that this couldn't have been the first time that it's happened.

A few weeks after that, my in-laws kicked out their 18yo son, and he was only given three days to gather his things. After those three days, he spent a night in a church parking lot, at least one night with his grandparents, and then was graciously allowed to stay at his mom's house again. This sparked a lot of controversy within their household. A lot of feelings were brought up as everyone felt a bit blindsided. My one and only SIL, who's 12, admitted to my husband and I that she never feels safe around her parents. She told us that she wanted to live with us. My 17yo BIL claimed to feel the same way. He said that he ""feels sick every time he walks in the door."" My siblings-in-law have always expressed a desire to live with me, even before I married their brother, but this information just broke my heart. Home, with mom and dad, should always feel safe.

We started getting calls from my SIL quite often (she uses their home phone to call). She would always be sobbing, telling us that she just needs us around so that she can feel safe. She wanted to sleep over at our house. After a few of these calls, we went over to my in-laws house, and I'll admit that I was very upset. My husband and I told them that they need to respect their children's boundaries and stop trying to control them if they want their children to feel safe around them, but my in-laws insisted that there was nothing unsafe about their home. My SIL was shaking. She refused to speak to her parents. She was crying so hard she couldn't breathe. Even still, her parents insisted that they couldn't possibly be the cause of her feelings. The only way that my SIL was even able to speak was if I held her in my arms. Despite my SIL's efforts, my in-laws managed to coax her back inside and she didn't sleep over with us. Neither my husband nor I have seen her since.

During our conversation/argument, my MIL claimed that my 12yo SIL doesn't know what she's talking about when she says that she wants to live with us. She said that my husband's siblings just want to see us more often. But they definitely don't actually want to live with us. They just don't understand what it means to live with someone else. (My 6yo BIL has also made many comments about living with my husband and I instead of his parents.)

This argument happened weeks ago, and despite attempts to make plans with my siblings-in-law, we haven't seen any of them. Finally, my MIL admitted that she won't let them see us until the issues between my MIL, FIL, husband, and I have been resolved. She has also made no effort to resolve these issues with us, and we don't know exactly what issues she's referring to.

My SIL can only call us when her parents aren't home, which is still fairly often. She has started keeping a journal of everything that her parents do to her physically and verbally. She says that she wants us to adopt her, which I know is unrealistic, but I do know that I need to do something to keep her safe.

Today, she called to tell us that her dad grabbed her arm very tightly and twisted it, which left some red marks, but not necessarily bruises. I really want to call CPS. I want this little girl to feel safe, and I want her to know that someone is willing to stand beside her. My husband asked his 17yo brother to confirm what the red marks looked like, and asked him what he thought about us potentially calling CPS (my SIL didn't hear this part of the conversation). My BIL admitted that he was hesitant to encourage us to call because he was afraid of what might happen next. He told us that he thinks we should wait until the school year starts because he believes that the abuse will escalate to more obvious and reportable levels.

I understand what he means. He's worried that there isn't enough evidence against his parents because most of their abuse is verbal/mental/emotional and not as physical. I understand that calling CPS without much evidence probably won't lead to any actual results, and it might even make things worse for the children.

But on the other hand, I'm a mother. I can't just sit idly by and watch these innocent children get hurt. I'm so torn on what to do.

Any advice? Anything I should know before making a call to CPS? What evidence do I need to have a case? Is there any good way to get evidence of verbal abuse? None of the kids have phones, so taking videos doesn't seem to be an option.

I'm also open to any advice on how to help these kids feel safe even when we aren't there. Thanks in advance!

Edit: CPS has been called on my in-laws before because they've left their underage children at a park alone for extended periods of time and without notice, but nothing came of it. Neighbors have threatened to call CPS because my in-laws lock my 6yo BIL outside when he's upset, and they've been doing that frequently since he was 3.","Even after my husband moved in with me, he was expected to babysit his siblings for free. She told us that she wanted to live with us. She would always be sobbing, telling us that she just needs us around so that she can feel safe. My husband and I told them that they need to respect their children's boundaries and stop trying to control them if they want their children to feel safe around them, but my in-laws insisted that there was nothing unsafe about their home. My SIL can only call us when her parents aren't home, which is still fairly often.","[{'author': 'Rich_Cause5589', 'score': 2, 'body': ""You and your husband have no right to see his underage siblings if the parents don't want you to.

"What are my options after employer bounced check, denied healthcare, and misclassified me?",1,1mgrnzu,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mgrnzu/what_are_my_options_after_employer_bounced_check/,2025-08-03 14:10:47,Effective_Rub9189,0,https://www.reddit.com/r/legaladvice/comments/1mgrnzu/what_are_my_options_after_employer_bounced_check/,"Location: Minneapolis, Minnesota

For seven months, I worked for a small business that claimed to be a legacy company, 70+ years in business, $20 million in annual revenue, and supposedly rock solid. I was hired to clean up a massive backlog of orders and customer service issues left behind by a previous employee who, I’d later learn, quit due to the same payroll problems I’d end up facing. I was promised a substantial raise after 6 months that never came, despite exceeding expectations.

In the beginning, things seemed promising. I’m a father of two children with special needs and have serious health issues myself. I need flexibility for doctor appointments, and this job gave me more than any other ever had. That flexibility and the fact that paychecks didn’t start arriving late until about three to four months in is the only reason I stayed as long as I did.

But when things turned, they turned hard. Paychecks started coming late almost every pay period. Then one of them bounced completely. I reached out immediately, and it still wasn’t fixed for four weeks. And that bounced check had already arrived almost a week late to begin with.

The financial damage was instant. I went into overdraft. My bank accounts were hit with fees. Bills went unpaid. My wife had to cash out her 401(k). We had to borrow money from family members who were already struggling. The bounced check triggered a warning from our bank, if another check or deposit is reversed, both my personal and joint accounts will be shut down.

Despite it all, I kept working. I had to. I was clocking unpaid overtime, staying after hours to handle freight shipments, working through breaks and lunches, and managing customer relationships long after the office officially closed. I asked to be added to the company’s health insurance plan after losing state coverage. I was ignored repeatedly. I have screenshots proving that.

Because of that denial, I had to pay $124.79 out-of-pocket for a single refill of a vital bipolar medication. I went without it for just a week, but that was enough to throw my anxiety into overdrive and completely destroy my sleep until I could finally afford to pay for it. Another medication I take for a rare autoimmune condition costs over $2,000 out-of-pocket without insurance, and I had to go without that one entirely for months.

Things eventually spiraled to a breaking point. One day, while working alone in the office (a regular occurrence), I was personally served an eviction notice on behalf of the company. That’s how we found out the business owner hadn’t paid rent on the office for over six months. Still, we were expected to keep showing up even after a “No Trespassing” notice was taped to the door by law enforcement.

The business owner couldn’t be reached. I have a recorded call with a company officer where he outright admits the owner wasn’t responding to texts or calls — even about our paychecks. Meanwhile, the owner was vacationing multiple times during all of this. He was still going to vendor shows, keeping up appearances, while we were begging to be paid what we had already earned.

Eventually I discovered that the company had been falsifying pay stubs. The stubs showed we were being paid on time, but my bank statements clearly show otherwise. I wasn’t the only one, other employees also had delayed or bounced paychecks but they made significantly more than me and had been there longer, so they were financially able to look the other way. I wasn’t.

I was also misclassified as an independent contractor, even though my job met every legal requirement of a W-2 employee: regular hours, supervision, employer equipment, training, no operational independence. As a result, the company didn’t withhold Social Security, Medicare, or unemployment taxes.

All of this took a heavy toll. My mental health deteriorated. My bipolar symptoms flared up. The anxiety and depression were unbearable. I was injured in a car accident and then told to return to the now-evicted office to operate heavy equipment (like a forklift) without certification. I was never trained, and neither was the other worker who’d been helping me, he also told me he was receiving checks late, and eventually laid off as a result of the eviction.

I’ve reached out to multiple employment law firms. All but one turned me down despite me offering clear evidence:

• Screenshots of the owner ignoring my wage and insurance requests
• A recorded phone call with a company officer confirming the owner was unreachable regarding bounced paychecks
• Bank statements showing late payments and the consequences that followed
• Screenshots of falsified paystubs
• Proof that I paid out-of-pocket for vital medication because I was denied insurance
• Timestamped emails and internal messages showing unpaid overtime
• Evidence proving I was misclassified as a contractor
• An eviction notice I was personally served while on the clock
• Testimony that others were also dealing with bounced and late checks but were financially positioned to endure it
• Confirmation that the employee I replaced had quit due to the same problems

The lawsuit hasn’t been filed yet. I don’t want a payday. I want accountability. I want this man held responsible so he can’t keep doing this to other people.

What can I do? How can I make sure this sticks? With all this proof, is there still a chance he could walk away from this unscathed?

I’m looking for advice. I’ve done everything right. I’ve collected the proof. I’ve endured the damage. Now I want to nail this guy for brazenly shitting all over us, if he gets away with this he will continue to screw people.
